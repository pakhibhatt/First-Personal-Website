Welcome to my first personal website! I created this website in October 2024 with updates made in December 2024 and January 2025. 
This was originally a milestone in the Global Career Accelerator Web Dev program, but was then customized to be used personally.

Technologies used:
	-HTML
	-Bootstrap CSS
	-CodeSandbox


Future Improvements:
	-Include JavaScript component to contact me
	-Include JavaScript for animations and more streamlined transitions
	-Continually update courses and skills
	-Continually update projects as I learn and gain more experience
