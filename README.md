Welcome to my first personal website! I created this website in October 2024 with updates made in December 2024 and January 2025.<br/>
This was originally a milestone in the Global Career Accelerator Web Dev program, but was then customized to be used personally.<br/><br/>

Technologies used:<br/>
	-HTML<br/>
	-Bootstrap CSS<br/>
	-CodeSandbox<br/><br/>


Future Improvements:<br/>
	-Include JavaScript component to contact me<br/>
	-Include JavaScript for animations and more streamlined transitions<br/>
	-Continually update courses and skills<br/>
	-Continually update projects as I learn and gain more experience<br/>
